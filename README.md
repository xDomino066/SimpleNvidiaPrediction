# Simple Nvidia Stock Prediction (Legacy Project)

This is one of my initial Deep Learning projects focused on predicting NVIDIA stock prices using LSTM neural networks.

### Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned:
* Implemented basic **LSTM architecture** using PyTorch.
* **Educational Value:** This project highlighted the challenges of data scaling and market microstructure. The initial model struggled with price averaging, which led me to develop more advanced architectures (Transformers) in my later projects (see: Titan Project).
